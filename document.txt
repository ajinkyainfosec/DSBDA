Text analytics is the process of extracting meaningful insights from textual data. It involves various preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. These techniques help in structuring unstructured text, making it easier to analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a significant role in text analytics by enabling machines to understand and process human language. Applications of text analytics include sentiment analysis, document classification, and information retrieval. By computing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), we can identify important words in a document relative to a collection of documents.
